Registration services attribute a unique functional ID to a person, place or other entity to identify and access information about it. According to the World Bank, functional IDs are those that evolve out of a single use-case, such as voter IDs, health records, or bank cards, and are created with a specific purpose in mind, differing from foundational IDs which are created with a general purpose in mind. Registration services can also use the foundational ID or map it to the functional ID where such an identity exists. Examples of specific registration services include immunization, disease and citizenship records, as well as birth and death registration. The ensemble of utilities for capturing, recording, profiling, searching, retrieving and verifying this identity information is encapsulated as registration services. The information itself will be deposited into and retrieved from corresponding functional registries (see the Registries ICT Building Blocks). Registration services help profile entities by enabling the registration of different categories or groups and documenting their access to various services. These services also onboard users into a programme or service offered by an organization (eg rural advisory service), capturing related demography, profile and citizen ID information.

The GIS (geographic information services) building block aims to “geo-enable” various applications by providing locational information capabilities through the integration of spatial data such as maps, imagery, and location-based services. Users can find and link geographic locations with "objects" like people (e.g., patients, doctors, farmers, agricultural extensionists), places (e.g., hospitals, ambulances, labs, seed production facilities), equipment (e.g., ventilators, vaccine containers), or sites (e.g., water sources, agricultural fields). This geographic association may also have a timestamp of when it was acquired and be tagged with a unique digital identifier. Applications or components using geographical information services can collect, share, and use temporal and spatial information with other applications, such as map repositories and data visualization tools, where it can be displayed on geographical maps. The data can also be combined with other datasets, such as population, surveillance, or supply chain data sets, to enable geospatial and spatiotemporal analysis. A country’s differing data privacy policies may affect how much information geographic information services can gather. This building block can be used for a variety of applications and use cases, for example:

#### Incident Management System: <a href="#use-case-1-gis-based-incident-management-system" id="use-case-1-gis-based-incident-management-system"></a>

* Locate an emergency call with a gazetteer or/and address services
* Dispatch incident information with verified geographic locations
* Provide routing and tracking services for emergency vehicles and resources
* Archive incident report with verified geographic locations
* Display geographic incident information on a map

#### Land Records/Cadastre Management: <a href="#use-case-2-land-records-cadastre-management" id="use-case-2-land-records-cadastre-management"></a>

* Display land parcels and their associated records on a map
* Compare/measure the geometry of a land parcel in different periods
* Divide/unite land parcels

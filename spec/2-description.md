# 2 Description

The GIS (geographic information services) building block aims to “geo-enable” various applications by providing locational information capabilities through the integration of spatial data such as maps, imagery, and location-based services. Users can find and link geographic locations with "objects" like people (e.g., patients, doctors, farmers, agricultural extensionists), places (e.g., hospitals, ambulances, labs, seed production facilities), equipment (e.g., ventilators, vaccine containers), or sites (e.g., water sources, agricultural fields). This geographic association may also have a timestamp of when it was acquired and be tagged with a unique digital identifier. Applications or components using geographical information services can collect, share, and use temporal and spatial information with other applications, such as map repositories and data visualization tools, which can be displayed on geographical maps. The data can also be combined with other datasets, such as population, surveillance, or supply chain data sets, to enable geospatial and spatiotemporal analysis. A country’s differing data privacy policies may affect how much information geographic information services can gather. This building block can be used for a variety of applications and use cases, for example:

#### Incident Management System: <a href="#use-case-1-gis-based-incident-management-system" id="use-case-1-gis-based-incident-management-system"></a>

* Locate an emergency call with a gazetteer or/and address services
* Dispatch incident information with verified geographic locations
* Provide routing and tracking services for emergency vehicles and resources
* Archive incident report with verified geographic locations
* Display geographic incident information on a map

#### Land Records/Cadastre Management: <a href="#use-case-2-land-records-cadastre-management" id="use-case-2-land-records-cadastre-management"></a>

* Display land parcels and their associated records on a map
* Compare/measure the geometry of a land parcel in different periods
* Divide/unite land parcels

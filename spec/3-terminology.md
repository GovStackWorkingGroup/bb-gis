<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="203"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Term</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Client</strong></td><td>Client is a software component that can invoke an operation from a server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Coordinate</strong></td><td>A coordinate is a sequence of n numbers designating the position of a point in n-dimensional space.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Coordinate system</strong></td><td>A set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Coordinate reference system</strong></td><td>A coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geocoding</strong></td><td>The process of converting an address or place name into geographic coordinates</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geographic feature</strong>:</td><td>Geographic features are real-world phenomena associated with a location relative to the Earth, about which data are collected, maintained, and disseminated. Feature catalogues defining the types of features, their operations, attributes, and associations represented in geographic data are indispensable to turning the data into usable information. Such feature catalogues promote the dissemination, sharing, and use of geographic data through providing a better understanding of the content and meaning of the data. (ISO 19110).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Global positioning system (GPS)</strong></td><td>A satellite-based navigation system that provides location and time information.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GIS Service Area</strong></td><td>The geographic area that can be reached within a specified time or distance from a given location.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Interface</strong></td><td>Interface is a named set of operations that characterize the behavior of an entity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Layer</strong></td><td>A collection of geospatial data that is displayed on a map, typically represent one feature type such as points, lines, polygons, and rasters, corresponding to a specific theme (parcels, street addresses, roads). </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operation</strong></td><td>An operation specifies a transformation or query that an object may be called to execute.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Server and service</strong></td><td>Server is a particular instance of a service. A service is distinct part of the functionality that is provided by an entity through interfaces.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Service metadata</strong></td><td>Service metadata describes the operations and geographic information available at a server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong></td><td>The process of examining geographic data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Remote Sensing</strong></td><td>The process of collecting data about the environment from a distance, typically using satellites or aircraft.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Request</strong></td><td>A request is an invocation of an operation by a client</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Response</strong></td><td>A response is a result of an operation returned from a server to a client.</td></tr></tbody></table>
